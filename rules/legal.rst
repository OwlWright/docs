Gates
===============
Gates may only be placed on property that you own. If you do not own the property, the owner of the property must grant you permission to place a gate on the property. In order to request a gate, contact the Mapping Team. You must provide logs of gate installation after the Mapping Team accepts your gate. 

Generic Items
==========
All legally obtainable generics must be purchased IC in shops or by official factions that import requested items. Generics that are of illegal use or a special type must be spawned by an administrator. Generics that adversly affect others during roleplay situations must be present. An example being: leather gloves during a murder. One cannot passive RP having leather gloves, as it adversly affects others when it comes to leaving evidence behind in the RP situation. 

However, if a roleplay situation does not adversly affect others and the item would reasonably be present, one can RP using it regardless of having a generic. An example being if you have a toolbox generic and roleplay taking a hammer from it, without having the actual item.

Everyday items such as gum, newspapers, or other items of insignificance do not have to be spawned as generics to roleplay having so long as they do not adversly affect others.

Generic items are not to be used in world 0 to replace exterior world mapping. Contact the mapping team if you wish to have a map added.

Interiors
==========
When purchasing an interior you must also buy the associated interiors that come with it. An example being buying a house, and having to buy the garage that comes with it. You may not buy a garage and then not buy the house. If you do this, you will have the interior removed from you.

If an interior is disabled via means of roleplay such as a fire, natural disaster, etc, it must be renovated to be enabled again. Roleplay must be provided to an administrator and documented in the interiors history.

Weapon Licenses
==========
Weapon licenses can be attained in character by filing the required paperwork found on the Los Santos Police Department website. 

Legally purchased weapons and ammunition may not be sold on the black market or to friends. Illegal weaponry is to be obtained through other means. Legally purchased weapons may also not be used for criminal purposes, as it is unrealistic for someone to use a legally registered firearm to commit crimes. Legal weapons are mainly used for self-defense and hobbies.

It is prohibited to stat transfer weapons as they are bound to one character realistically. If caught doing this, punishment similar to alt to alt will occur.

Tier 1 and 2 licenses availbiites and restrictions are dependent on the in character laws at the time. A tier 3 license (explosives) must be requested from the Faction Team.
